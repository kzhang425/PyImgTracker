# PyImgTracker

## Project Description
This project is based off of TrackPy (see https://github.com/soft-matter/trackpy) and is designed as a way to use it for my lab purposes.
Other than that, it's not really much of a breakthrough and more of a learning process for me. There will definitely be some cursed code in here and I am aware of it.
What can I say, I'm not a computer science major by training.

## Goals
Make a good command line interface program that uses the tools provided by TrackPy in a semi-intuitive way.

## Usage
Use Jupyter Lab to use the interactive file. Make sure Jupyter Lab is installed on your computer. After that, type in 
```jupyter-lab``` into command prompt/shell to activate it in order to open ```interactive.ipynb```.
